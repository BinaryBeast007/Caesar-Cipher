# Caesar-Cipher
The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique. It’s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift.
